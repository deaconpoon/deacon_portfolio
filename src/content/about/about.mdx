Â¡Hola! Bienvenido

I am a UX engineer who is passionate about everything on the web.

In my natural habitat, you can find me solving problems using design thinking, creating wireframe and prototyping, designing user interaction, iterating, and testing the ideas to building solutions with modern technologies fueled with high doses of caffeine.

I enjoy getting my hands dirty on designing and building things and solving intricate problems.
